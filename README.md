# 1024-Game

## Description

1024 is a game where the player has to move tiles in four different directions (up, down, right and left). The tiles contain numbers and when the move is done the tiles with equal values merge. The game ends when there are no more possible movements or the player reach the last tile, the one with the 1024 value. After that, a score is calculated based on the value of the tiles merged.
